# Game Awards Auto-Unmute Script

half-joke project that I made on a whim while watching the game awards

Simple Tampermonkey script that reads the Twitch captions, then unmutes the stream anytime someone says 'World Premiere'.

Obviously, enable captions on Twitch for this to work.

Also obviously not perfect, as not every game is announced as being a 'world premiere'. Might update this with some of the other common reveal phrases ('take a look', 'exclusive', etc.) in time for the next game awards.


do whatever you want with this code idc
